    Abstract = {We study the simultaneous use of multiple modeling techniques in the design of embedded systems. We begin with a pre-existing Statecharts model of a simple case study, a traffic light for a pedestrian crossing. This model combines two distinct models of computation (MoCs), finite state machines (FSMs) and synchronous/reactive (SR). We add an additional MoC to the mix, a discrete-event (DE) model of the environment in which the traffic light operates, including a simple fault model. We construct a second model of a hardware deployment. This exercise reveals hidden assumptions in the original model about implementation that require refactoring to get a distributed deployment model. We show that the portions of the models defining the control logic of the lights can be shared between the functional and deployment models using actor-oriented classes. This eases maintenance of the models. Finally, we show that models used for verification are abstractions of the functional models that can be synthesized from the other models, suggesting practical design-for-verification techniques. The result is that this simple example uses three distinct models of the system (functional, deployment, verification), two of which hierarchically combine distinct modeling techniques (DE, SR, FSM).}

abstract="We introduce the framework of hybrid automata as a model and specification language for hybrid systems. Hybrid automata can be viewed as a generalization of timed automata, in which the behavior of variables is governed in each state by a set of differential equations. We show that many of the examples considered in the workshop can be defined by hybrid automata. While the reachability problem is undecidable even for very restricted classes of hybrid automata, we present two semidecision procedures for verifying safety properties of piecewiselinear hybrid automata, in which all variables change at constant rates. The two procedures are based, respectively, on minimizing and computing fixpoints on generally infinite state spaces. We show that if the procedures terminate, then they give correct answers. We then demonstrate that for many of the typical workshop examples, the procedures do terminate and thus provide an automatic way for verifying their properties.",

abstract="The term hybrid systems is used in the literature to refer to systems that feature an interaction between diverse types of dynamics. Most heavily studied in recent years are hybrid systems that involve the interaction between continuous dynamics (with a dense state space and evolution determined by differential or difference equations) and discrete dynamics (with a finite or countable state space and evolution according to finite state machines, Petri nets, or other discrete models of computation). The study of this class of systems has to a large extent been motivated by applications to embedded systems and control. Embedded systems by definition involve the interaction of digital devices with a predominantly analog environment. In addition, much of the design complexity of embedded systems comes from the fact that they have to meet specifications such as hard real-time constraints, scheduling constraints, etc. that involve a mixture of discrete and continuous requirements. Therefore, both the model and the specifications of embedded systems can naturally be expressed in the context of hybrid systems. Motivated by the observation that embedded systems often also have to deal with an uncertain and potentially adversarial environment, researchers have in recent years extended their study of hybrid systems beyond continuous and discrete dynamics, to include probabilistic terms. This has led to the more general class of stochastic hybrid systems.",

Based on a formal interpretation of these as 		  graphs and graph transformation systems, we are able to 		  validate the consistency between platform and application. 		  We exemplify the approach for platforms realizing the 		  service-oriented architectural style and a supply chain 		  management system as application scenario. Besides, we 		  demonstrate the potential of model checking for graph 		  transformation systems for answering the above consistency question.},

      ABSTRACT = {We present MMC, a model checker for mobile systems specified in the style of the pi-calculus. MMC's development builds on that of XMC, a model checker for an expressive extension of Milner's value-passing calculus implemented using the XSB tabled logic-programming engine. MMC addresses the salient issues that arise in the pi-calculus, including scope extrusion and intrusion, and dynamic generation of new names to avoid name capture. We show that logic programming provides an efficient implementation platform for model checking pi-calculus specifications, and can be used to obtain an exact encoding of the pi-calculus's transitional semantics. Moreover, MMC is easily extended to handle process expressions in the spi-calculus of Abadi and Gordon. Our experimental data shows that MMC outperforms other known tools for model checking the pi-calculus.},

Therefore, the creation of a modeling methodology for PNs compatible with the IEC61131 standard is a necessity of automation specialists. Different works dealing with this subject have been carried out; they are presented in the first part of this paper [Frey (2000a, 2000b); Peng and Zhou (IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern, Part C Appl Rev 34(4):523--531, 2004); Uzam and Jones (Int J Adv Manuf Technol 14(10):716--728, 1998)], but they do not present a completely compatible methodology with this standard. At the same time, they do not maintain the simplicity required for such applications, nor the use of all-graphical and all-mathematical ordinary Petri net (OPN) tools to facilitate model verification and validation. The proposal presented here completes these requirements. Educational applications at the USP and UEA (Brazil) and the UO (Cuba), as well as industrial applications in Brazil and Cuba, have already been carried out with good results.",

Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many realvalued clocks . A timed automaton accepts timed words --- infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both Buchi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are...},

      ABSTRACT = {Cyber-physical systems achieve sophisticated system behavior exploring the tight interconnection of physical coupling present in classical engineering systems and information technology based coupling. A particular challenging case are systems where these cyber-physical systems are formed ad hoc according to the specific local topology, the available networking capabilities, and the goals and constraints of the subsystems captured by the information processing part. In this paper we present a formalism that permits to model the sketched class of cyber-physical systems. The ad hoc formation of tightly coupled subsystems of arbitrary size are specified using a UML-based graph transformation system approach. Differential equations are employed to define the resulting tightly coupled behavior. Together, both form hybrid graph transformation systems where the graph transformation rules define the discrete steps where the topology or modes may change, while the differential equations capture the 
continuous behavior in between such discrete changes. In addition, we demonstrate that automated analysis techniques known for timed graph transformation systems for inductive invariants can be extended to also cover the hybrid case for an expressive case of hybrid models where the formed tightly coupled subsystems are restricted to smaller local networks. },

Self-adaptive systems provide a vision how the systems can become capable of doing a large fraction of the required adaptations autonomously. In this paper we first discuss what is required to model correct self-adaptive systems. We then present the formal model of graph transformation systems which serves most of the identified needs. Based on this findings we outline how UML class and object diagrams as well as extensions for the modeling of behavior based upon graph transformation systems can be employed to model correct self-adaptive system. An application example is used to present how the approach can be employed to model self-adaptive systems at a high level of abstraction and means to ensure its correctness are discussed.}

      ABSTRACT = {Advanced mechatronic systems have to integrate existing technologies from mechanical, electrical and software engineering. They must be able to adapt their structure and behavior at runtime by reconfiguration to react flexibly to changes in the environment. Therefore, a tight integration of structural and behavioral models of the different domains is required. This integration results in complex reconfigurable hybrid systems, the execution logic of which cannot be addressed directly with existing standard modeling, simulation, and code-generation techniques. We present in this paper how our component-based approach for reconfigurable mechatronic systems, MECHATRONIC UML, efficiently handles the complex interplay of discrete behavior and continuous behavior in a modular manner. In addition, its extension to even more flexible reconfiguration cases is presented.},

abstract="Process algebras are formalisms for modelling concurrent systems that permit mathematical reasoning with respect to a set of desired properties. TAPAs is a tool that can be used to support the use of process algebras to specify and analyze concurrent systems. It does not aim at guaranteeing high performances, but has been developed as a support to teaching. Systems are described as process algebras terms that are then mapped to labelled transition systems (LTSs). Properties are verified either by checking equivalence of concrete and abstract systems descriptions, or by model checking temporal formulae over the obtained LTS. A key feature of TAPAs, that makes it particularly suitable for teaching, is that it maintains a consistent double representation of each system both as a term and as a graph. Another useful didactical feature is the exhibition of counterexamples in case equivalences are not verified or the proposed formulae are not satisfied.",

      ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, software systems are getting more and more complex. To tackle this challenge most diverse techniques, such as design patterns, service oriented architectures (SOA), software development processes, and model-driven engineering (MDE), are used to improve productivity, while time to market and quality of the products stay stable. Multiple of these techniques are used in parallel to profit from their benefits. While the use of sophisticated software development processes is standard, today, MDE is just adopted in practice. However, research has shown that the application of MDE is not always successful. It is not fully understood when advantages of MDE can be used and to what degree MDE can also be disadvantageous for productivity. Further, when combining different techniques that aim to affect the same factor (e.g. productivity) the question arises whether these techniques really complement each other or, in contrast, compensate their effects. Due to that, there is the concrete question how MDE and other techniques, such as software development process, are interrelated. Both aspects (advantages and disadvantages for productivity as well as the interrelation to other techniques) need to be understood to identify risks relating to the productivity impact of MDE. Before studying MDE's impact on productivity, it is necessary to investigate the range of validity that can be reached for the results. This includes two questions. First, there is the question whether MDE's impact on productivity is similar for all approaches of adopting MDE in practice. Second, there is the question whether MDE's impact on productivity for an approach of using MDE in practice remains stable over time. The answers for both questions are crucial for handling risks of MDE, but also for the design of future studies on MDE success. This thesis addresses these questions with the goal to support adoption of MDE in future. To enable a differentiated discussion about MDE, the term MDE setting'' is introduced. MDE setting refers to the applied technical setting, i.e. the employed manual and automated activities, artifacts, languages, and tools. An MDE setting's possible impact on productivity is studied with a focus on changeability and the interrelation to software development processes. This is done by introducing a taxonomy of changeability concerns that might be affected by an MDE setting. Further, three MDE traits are identified and it is studied for which manifestations of these MDE traits software development processes are impacted. To enable the assessment and evaluation of an MDE setting's impacts, the Software Manufacture Model language is introduced. This is a process modeling language that allows to reason about how relations between (modeling) artifacts (e.g. models or code files) change during application of manual or automated development activities. On that basis, risk analysis techniques are provided. These techniques allow identifying changeability risks and assessing the manifestations of the MDE traits (and with it an MDE setting's impact on software development processes). To address the range of validity, MDE settings from practice and their evolution histories were capture in context of this thesis. First, this data is used to show that MDE settings cover the whole spectrum concerning their impact on changeability or interrelation to software development processes. Neither it is seldom that MDE settings are neutral for processes nor is it seldom that MDE settings have impact on processes. Similarly, the impact on changeability differs relevantly. Second, a taxonomy of evolution of MDE settings is introduced. In that context it is discussed to what extent different types of changes on an MDE setting can influence this MDE setting's impact on changeability and the interrelation to processes. The category of structural evolution, which can change these characteristics of an MDE setting, is identified. The captured MDE settings from practice are used to show that structural evolution exists and is common. In addition, some examples of structural evolution steps are collected that actually led to a change in the characteristics of the respective MDE settings. Two implications are: First, the assessed diversity of MDE settings evaluates the need for the analysis techniques that shall be presented in this thesis. Second, evolution is one explanation for the diversity of MDE settings in practice. To summarize, this thesis studies the nature and evolution of MDE settings in practice. As a result support for the adoption of MDE settings is provided in form of techniques for the identification of risks relating to productivity impacts.}
