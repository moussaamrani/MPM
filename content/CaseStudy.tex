\section{Case study}

TODO: Starting from the examples, a systematic application of the given definition and the use of the Multi Paradigm Modeling in the case (maybe MPM as a unifying framework for the chosen examples in a CPS system?)

CLASSICAL EXAMPLES OF PARADIGMS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item OO
    \item Discrete events
    \item Functional
    \item Event based
    \item Synchronous data flow
    \item Agile
    \item Multiformalism modeling
    \item Multiparadigm ?
\end{itemize}
