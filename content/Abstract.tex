\begin{abstract}
Multi Paradigm Modeling is a modeling approach that coherently embraces multiple modeling formalisms, multiple relationships between formalisms, multiple workflows for the manipulation of models and formalisms, according to a given intent with a certain (set of) goal(s). This notwithstanding, a proper general definition of modeling paradigm and multi-paradigm modeling, together with some conceptual tools that allow to compare approaches, is missing, and is worth of discussion.

In COST Action IC1404 MPM4CPS (Multi Paradigm Modeling for Cyber Physical Systems) much work has been dedicated to systematically explore the ways in which currently Cyber Physical Systems are modeled with various intents and goals, in the perspective of Multi Paradigm Modeling. The analysis of this subject has been driven by the will for using a category of complex and diverse systems, characterized by requirements at different levels and from different viewpoints, to support the definition of a conceptual framework by dealing with significant examples and counterexamples.
