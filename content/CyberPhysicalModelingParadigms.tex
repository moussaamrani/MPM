\section{Cyber-Physcial System \& (Modeling) Paradigms}	

\section{Cyber-Physical System Development}

In case of cyber-physical systems, models and their employed formalisms can be employed to capture fragments of the cyber and the physical part of the overall systems. Accordingly, we name a multi-paradigm scenario cyber-physcial if both kinds of fragments are covered. 

\subsection{Cyber-Physical Scenario}

\begin{definition}[cyber-physical scenario]
A \emph{cyber-physical scenario} is a scenario where the models and their employed formalisms capture fragments of both the cyber and  physical parts of an overall systems.
